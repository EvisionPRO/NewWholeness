                My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book together. The author admonishes paralytics NOT to be defined by their disability, but to find purpose, soar with hope and aspire to wholeness.

                I deal daily with children with heart disease. A big difficulty they face is being defined by their physical condition. Dr. Adams insists our physical circumstances do not define us. This book, which contains much practical advice for people with paralysis and other injuries, lays out a sound approach to living with hope as a loved child of God. I strongly endorse this most helpful book.
