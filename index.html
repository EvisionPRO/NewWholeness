            My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book together. The author admonishes paralytics NOT to be defined by their disability, but to find purpose, soar with hope and aspire to wholeness.<br />

            As a M.D., I have worked in many trauma centers and been committed for many years to resources on trauma and health for patients, families and practitioners. I have never read a guide that is as practical and useful as this book.<br />
