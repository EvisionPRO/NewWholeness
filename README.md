## Wholeness Landing Page
A landing page for the book "Wholeness is Possible" and the main purpose of that page is to practice my coding skills.

The website should have options to buy either hardcopy or digital pdf version and after purchase collect information about buyers and transaction. 

If user chooses digital copy, then he should have an option to login in and  download PDF file with the book.

## Motivation
The original website is built on Wordpress http://wholenessispassible.com and I want to learn how to use Angular.js and Bootstrap instead of CMS and also I want to add Javascript features.
